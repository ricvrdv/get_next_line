[Intro]
Bad tattoos on leather-tanned skin
Jesus Christ on a plastic sign
Fall in love again and again
Winding roads, doing manual drive
Bad tattoos on leather-tanned skin
Jesus Christ on a plastic sign, mm
Early nights in white sheets with lace curtains
Capri in the distance

[Verse 1]
Bad tattoos on leather-tanned skin
Jesus Christ on a plastic sign
Fall in love again and again
Winding roads, doing manual drive
Bad tattoos on leather-tanned skin
Jesus Christ on a plastic sign
Fall in love again and again
Winding roads, doing manual drive
Early nights in white sheets with lace curtains
Capri in the distance
In a place that can make you change
Fall in love again and again
Early nights in white sheets with lace curtains
Capri in the distance
In a place that can make you change
Fall in lo-o-o-o-o-o—

[Chorus]
Everything is
Romantic, uh
Evеrything is
Romantic, uh
Everything is
Romantic (Uh)
Everything is
Romantic, uh

[Verse 2]
Lemons on thе trees and on the ground
Sandals on the stirrups of the scooters
Neon orange drinks on the beach
Four generations make up for family
Lemons on the trees and on the ground
Sandals on the stirrups of the scooters
Neon orange drinks on the beach
Four generations make up for family
Early nights in white sheets with lace curtains
Pompeii in the distance
In a place that can make you change
Fall in love again and again
Early nights in white sheets with lace curtains
Pompeii in the distance
In a place that can make you change

Fall in love again and again
Fall in love again and again
Fall in love again and again
Fall in love again and again
Fall in love again and again (Woo)
Fall in love again and again
Fall in love again and again
Fall in love again and again
Fall in love again and again
Fall in love again and again
Fall in love again and again
Fall in love again and again
Fall in love again and again
Fall in love again and again (Everything is)
Fall in love again and again
Fall in love again and again (Uh)
Fall in love again and again
Fall in love again and again (Everything is)
Fall in love again and again
Fall in love again and again (Uh)
Fall in love again and again
Fall in love again and again (Everything is)
Fall in love again and again
Fall in love again and again (Uh)
